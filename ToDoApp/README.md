# First of all...

I just need to say that especially during the start of this project it's me throwing myself into the deep end. I've been using references and researching topics and concepts along the way so while at the moment the code written I understand it to a level I can adjust it and make changes if needed I haven't somehow come in here and magically been able to write it off the top of my head.

This is probably the best way that I can learn a new framework so again while the beginning might look a bit suspicious it's just me trying to get my bearings and an understanding of how everything's works by getting hands on with as much as possible!
